# Machine-Learning Project 01
Project Name: This is a Machine Learning Project 1 - Predicting TV Sales.

Project Description: Building a Machine Learning Model to predict the TV Sales.

Dataset: It has 2 attributes such as TV and Sales.

Link for Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leiadis/tvmarketing


--------------------------***************************************--------------------------

##Objective: 
To create an ML Model which can predict the Sales based on Pre-trained Sales data.

Libraries Used: sklearn, model_selection, train_test_split

Statistics Used: Simple Linear Regression

Checked Performance Using: mean_squared_error and r_squared

Result: 
Mean_Squared_Error:  7.97579853285485 
# Meaning our model is not able to predict correctly 7.9% saying in other way model was 92% accurate.

r_square_value:  0.5942987267783302   
# Meaning in real life data if R^2 value is 60 and above, it is a good model. So, this is a good model
